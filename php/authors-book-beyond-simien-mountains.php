					writer)</em></h5>
			<p>Ian Anderson is a scientist, his daughters
				Sabrina and Rebecca are both medical
				doctors, specialized in neonatology and
				paediatric intensive care. Although they
				live on different continents, there is
				nothing they like better than getting
				together to discover new horizons,
				encountering different cultures, diverse
				landscapes and getting to know the world
				“Beyond”.</p>
			<p>Sabrina and Rebecca have both worked as
				physicians in Africa and became enchanted
				with Ethiopia during their many visits
				volunteering as doctors in Gondar and Addis
				Ababa.</p>
			<p>Sabrina was inspired by one of her journeys
				to Ghana in 2002 to paint her impressions
				and sell those paintings at an exhibition in
				Jena, Germany, to raise funds for an
				orphanage in India.</p>
			<p>Rebecca has also spent time in Haiti and
				Lebanon, volunteering for Doctors Without
				Borders.</p>
			<p>Although they have published widely in their
				professional lives this is their first
				travel book.</p>
			<h3>OUR TREK THROUGH THE SIMIEN MOUNTAINS CAN
				ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS AN INCREDIBLE
				EXPERIENCE THANKS TO THE FRIENDS WE MADE
				ALONG THE WAY AND WHO WELCOMED US TO THEIR
				LAND.</h3>
