			<p> All the profits of the book will finance

			<p>We are still in contact with the community
				and the National Park to support local
				communities and notably the health center of
				Mekarebya village.</p>
			<p>We had no intention of publishing the picture
				story of our trek when we started; the idea
				was born round the camp fire at Mekarebya
				after having visited the health center there
				and being profoundly impressed by the
				doctors and staff who managed a facility
				with no running water â€“ all water had to be
				carried from a distant stream. <br> We
				wanted to help if we could.</p>
			<p>Perhaps we could publish a book and use the
				proceeds to help with a project to bring
				water to the center.</p>
			<p>It is still our dream.</p><br>
